# Modeling and predicting oceanic drifts of plastic waste with physical and data-driven approaches.

## Manon BÃ©chaz

This code is part of a Master's thesis aiming at predicting the oceanic drift of floating objects at the surface of the ocean, using both physical and data-driven approaches. More information on the goal and methods used can be found in the attached report. 
Some examples of use of the code to predict trajectories are provided in the notebooks.
